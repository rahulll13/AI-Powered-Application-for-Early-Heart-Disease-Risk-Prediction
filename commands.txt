 

## These are some of the commands that are used for the project:-

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

## for activating the backend server :-

flask run

## for activating the frontend server

1.cd frontend
2.python -m http.server
3.The frontend server is available on  http://localhost:8000 in your browser.



Now, you only need one terminal and one command to run your entire application.

1.  Open a **single terminal**.
2.  Navigate to your project's **root folder** (`Infosys Project`).
3.  Activate your virtual environment as usual:
    ```powershell
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
4.  Instead of running `flask run` or `python -m http.server`, just run your new script:
    ```powershell
    python start_servers.py
